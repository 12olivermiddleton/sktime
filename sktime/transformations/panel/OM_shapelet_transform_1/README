The Cython code is in the file utils.pyx, and is compiled using setup.py using the args, build_ext and --inplace
There are 4 files for experiments, 3 for running the shapelet transform:
- run_cython_ST.py
- run_shapelet_transform.py
- run_numba_ST.py

There is one file for measuring the accuracy:
- st_accuracy_experiment.py

There are 2 files containing the shapelet transform algorithm
- base_shapelet_transform.py is the ST with Numba stripped from the algorithm
- cython_shapelet_transform.py this is the shapelet transform class without the functions we optimise using Cython

There are instructions on the compilation of utils.pyx into an extension in the Cython_help notebook.
